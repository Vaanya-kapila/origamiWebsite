            <p><h4><center> Word origami originates from two words ori meaning “folding” and kami meaning “paper.” <br>
                These two words, origami can be defined as the practice of folding paper. <br>
                Origami is mostly associated with the Japanese culture, although its origins can also be traced to some parts of Europe and China. <br>
                The traditional art of origami focuses on folding paper without modifying it in any way, either by cutting, taping, marking, or gluing. <br>
                Although origami can take on many designs, the more popular model includes the Japanese paper crane. </center></h4></p>
